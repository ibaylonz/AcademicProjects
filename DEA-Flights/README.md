# DEA Project

In this project I used jupyter as the tool to work with python and its library "pandas" to answer to the next list of questions and tasks:

1. Start by cleaning the data.
2. Identify any null or missing data, and impute appropriate replacement values.
3. Identify and eliminate any outliers in the DepDelay and ArrDelay columns.
4. Explore the cleaned data.
5. View summary statistics for the numeric fields in the dataset.
6. Determine the distribution of the DepDelay and ArrDelay columns.
7. Use statistics, aggregate functions, and visualizations to answer the following questions:
8. What are the average (mean) departure and arrival delays?
9. How do the carriers compare in terms of arrival delay performance?
10. Is there a noticable difference in arrival delays for different days of the week?
11. Which departure airport has the highest average departure delay?
12. Do late departures tend to result in longer arrival delays than on-time departures?
13. Which route (from origin airport to destination airport) has the most late arrivals?
14. Which route has the highest average arrival delay?
